# papergen
generates a test paper given set paremeters

### using questionmaker.py
to use the questionmaker.py add questions with the question maker all you need to do is fill the variables and run the program the only prerequsit is that you have to have the papergen.py in the same folder beacause it actually adds the questions to it. it uses basic LaTex so you can use that

P.S.- this uses a counter file so it will start counting form 0 so the question1,2 and 3 will get repeated

### using the papergen.py
to use the papergen.py just change the variables and run the script. it should oputput a .Tex file you just need to conver the Tex file to a pdf.
